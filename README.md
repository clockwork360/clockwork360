<h1>Hello, I'm Dewayne! <br/><a href="https://github.com/clockwork360">Security Analyst</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dewayne-vanhorn-5244ab80/">LinkedIn</a></h1>

<br/><h2>Professional Statement Outline</h2>
Introduction
Hello,
My name is Dewayne VanHorn.
While we truly never get out of the learning phase, or shouldn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm constantly learning more and more about my place in the cybersecurity space. Recently I‚Äôve developed a passion for coding projects related to red teaming, and like Ansible, a python based automation tool for intra-service orchestration, I like building projects that help automate the ability to secure and relay network management tasks, and notify and/or have playbooks in place to negate or follow happenings in the network/system similar to IDS‚Äô/IPS‚Äô.

I enjoy studying for certifications, and am currently  working on my BS in cybersecurity at WGU. I hope to one day give back what I‚Äôve been taught in a cohesive, fun, and inviting manner for anyone who sees merit and can gain something from my work. 


Strengths
Strong written and verbal communication skills
Strong programming skills in the areas of: python, bash, rust, javascript
Tools Usage: Metasploit, SIEM, Burp Suite, Ansible, among many others. 


Values

I like understanding my own network and protecting it in order to appreciate and protect the network of my employer. This is why I‚Äôm diligent about learning and adapting new tools, and tradecraft into whatever project I‚Äôm working on, whether it is in a SOC, or getting better at incident response in my own network.

I also enjoy learning aspects of ethical hacking. Exploring different ways a system can be breached, and/or compromised so that I am armed with vectors to explore for mitigation, or just being current or even ahead of the cyber landscape. I believe to make the best version of a security analyst, they first need to understand what they are looking for, then how to deal with it once it arises. 


Clarity and Conclusion
The most interesting thing about the field of cybersecurity for me is its vast nature. While the feeling can be daunting to try to think about, the rewards of this can be tremendous. 
- If you don‚Äôt feel right in a position, there are many others you can gravitate to
-  ‚ÄúAlmost‚Äù being recession proof is a bonus for this type of field because there will always be jobs in tech for as long as we as a society are advancing.
- Knowing I am a part of the line of defense for attacks against an organization I work for, gives me great motivation at being at the top of my game for when situations occur.  

While this is for anyone interested, my aim is to give recruiters a high level overview of my potential. This way if I am in the market, or you are looking for someone that seems like a great fit for a SOC position, Security Engineering position, or a pentester, I am at the top of the list of candidates. 


Strengths, weaknesses, values, etc change overtime. My hope is that I can strengthen my strengths, strengthen my weaknesses at the time they are weak, so they become strengths, and work on my new weaknesses as they come. We are all human so the learning curve is forever vast, however, I wish to bring longevity to the security space, and actionable solutions the more and more I learn. I understand that the reason the security landscape is opening up more in this day and age, is because our reliance on technology is ever growing. The need for proper security and professionals that know what they are doing is at an all time high. I want to be an expert in this field, so others can confidently come to me for help find adequate solutions to future problems, while I do the same to learn and keep growing and getting better
